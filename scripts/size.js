/**
 * Honest bundle-size measurement for the README "Bundle size" table.
 *
 * Every entry from package.json#exports is bundled the way a consumer's
 * bundler would (browser condition for the browser half, plain Node
 * resolution for the node half), then reports:
 *   - raw:      bundled, un-minified
 *   - min:      fully minified (whitespace + identifier mangling + syntax,
 *               comments stripped)
 *   - min+gzip: the number that matters for shipping to browsers
 *
 * Only the entry that DOES reach a browser carries a `budget` (min+gzip KB),
 * and exceeding it fails the run, which is what keeps CI honest about bundle
 * growth. The node entry is reported for visibility, not as a shipping cost.
 *
 * Run with `pnpm size`.
